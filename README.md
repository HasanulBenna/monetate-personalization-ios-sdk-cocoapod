2. Update the version information and execute **upload.sh**
3. Obtain the JFrog URL and metadata
4. Update **Package.swift** with the new upload information, then commit and push the changes to the **monetate-personalization-ios-sdk-binary-config** repository.
5. Update the **Podspec** with the new upload information, then publish the updated Podspec to the CocoaPods trunk.

Installation:-

## Swift Package Manager (SPM)

The Monetate Personalization SDK can be integrated using Swift Package Manager.

Using Xcode:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select File → Add Packages
3. Enter the repository URL:
   https://github.com/monetate/monetate-personalization-ios-sdk.git
4. Choose 'main' branch or the required version
5. Add the package to your target

Using Package.swift:

Add the following dependency to your Package.swift file.

        dependencies: [
            .package(
                url: " https://github.com/monetate/monetate-personalization-ios-sdk.git",
                branch: "main"
            )
        ]


## CocoaPods
   
pod 'monetate-ios-sdk'


Getting started with development :-

  
    import  "monetate-ios-sdk"

Initialize 

       final var objPersonalization = Personalization(account: Account(instance: "p", domain: "localhost.org", name: "a-701b337c", shortname: "localhost"), 
                                                            user: User(deviceId: "11aa1a1a-111a-111a-11aa-11a1a1111a11"))

Report method:-

        // ContextObj based Approach
        let contextObj = ContextObj()
        try? contextObj.addPageDetails(pageType: "samplePage", path: nil, url: "sampleURL", categories: nil, breadcrumbs: nil)
        personalization.reportPageDetails(contextData: contextObj)

This method reports data to Engine API. It takes ContextObject instance, with associated event data. 


Get Action method

        do {
            try contextObj.addPurchaseData(purchaseId: "321", purchaseLineData: [PurchaseLine(sku: "sku1", pid: "pid1", quantity: 2, currency: "USD", value: "8")])
            try contextObj.addPurchaseData(purchaseId: "654", purchaseLineData: [PurchaseLine(sku: "sku2", pid: "pid2", quantity: 2, currency: "AED", value: "12")])
        }
        
        catch {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
        

        personalization.getActions(context: contextObj, arrActionTypes: ["monetate:action:OmnichannelJson"], includeReporting: false).on(success: { data in
            print(String(describing: data))

        }, failure:{ err in
            print(err.localizedDescription)
        })
            
This method is used to request decisions and report events as well. It returns object containing the JSON from appropriate actions. Includereporting accepts the boolean value true or false , true insists that response will have the impression reporting data, and false value insists that it will not have impression Reporting data in response. 

Flush method

        objPersonalization.flush();
        
For the sake of improving performance, events are queued and all sent at the same time (within a single request) after a 700ms interval is reached. The Flush method forces all enqueued events to be sent to the server immediately and clears the queue.
